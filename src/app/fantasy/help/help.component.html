                      <li>Open your Outlook mailbox.</li>

                        junk email) &gt; Safe senders.</li>
                      <li>In the space provided, enter the address -
                        noreply@mailout.users.premierleague.com</li>

                      <li>Ensure the safe mailing lists box has the address you entered, and
                        select OK.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Once this has been completed, please go back to the FPL site and follow

                      basis.</p>

                  <div id="collapsible-6" aria-hidden="true" class="ism-collapsible__content">
                    <p>The ICT Index is a football statistical index developed specifically to
                      assess a player as an FPL asset. It uses match event data to generate a
                      single score for three key areas – Influence, Creativity and Threat.
                      These figures then combine to create an individual’s ICT Index score. It
                      condenses more than 40 match event statistics into four distinct scores.
                      These offer a view on player performance for factors that are known to
                      produce FPL points.</p>
                    <p>1. Influence</p>
                    <p>Influence is the first measurement - this evaluates the degree to which
                      that player has made an impact on a match, or matches over the season.
                      It takes into account events and actions that could directly or
                      indirectly effect the match outcome. At the very top level these are
                      decisive actions like goals and assists. However, the Influence score
                      also processes significant defensive actions to analyse the
                      effectiveness of defenders and goalkeepers.

                    </p>
                    <p>2. Creativity</p>
                    <p>Creativity assesses player performance in terms of producing goal scoring
                      opportunities for others. It can be used as a guide to identify the
                      players most likely to supply assists. While this analyses frequency of
                      passing and crossing, it also considers pitch location and the
                      incisiveness of the final ball.
                    </p>
                    <p>3. Threat</p>
                    <p>Threat is the third measure, producing a value that examines a player’s
                      threat on goal; it therefore gauges those individuals most likely to
                      score goals. While attempts are the key action, the Index looks at pitch
                      location, giving greater weight to actions that are regarded as the best
                      openings to register a goal. All three of these scores are then combined
                      to create an overall ICT Index score. That then offers a single figure
                      that presents a view on that player as an FPL asset.</p>

                      <h5>Choosing your starting 11</h5>

                      <p>From your 15 player squad, select 11 players by the Gameweek <a
                          href="/a/help#" data-target="ismjs-rules-deadlines"
                          class="ismjs-link--rules">deadline</a> to form your team.</p>

                      <p>All your points for the Gameweek will be scored by these 11 players,
                        however if one or more doesn't play they may be automatically
                        substituted.

                      </p>
                      <p>Your team can play in any formation providing that 1 goalkeeper, at
                        least 3 defenders and at least 1 forward are selected at all times.

                      </p>
                      <h5>Selecting a Captain and a Vice-Captain</h5>

                      <p>From your starting 11 you nominate a captain and a vice-captain. Your
                        captain's score will be doubled.</p>

                      <p>If your captain plays 0 minutes in the Gameweek, the captain will be
                        changed to the vice-captain.</p>

                      <p>If both captain and vice-captain play 0 minutes in a Gameweek, then
                        no player's score will be doubled.</p>

                      <h5>Prioritising Your Bench For Automatic Substitutions</h5>

                      <p>Your substitutes provide cover for unforeseen events like injuries
                        and postponements by automatically replacing starting players who
                        don't play in a Gameweek.</p>

                      <p>For the purpose of automatic substitutions playing in a Gameweek
                        means playing at least 1 minute or receiving a yellow / red card.
                      </p>

                      <p>Based on the priorities you assign, automatic substitutions are
                        processed at the end of the Gameweek as follows:</p>

                      <ul>
                        <li>If your Goalkeeper doesn't play in the Gameweek, he will be
                          substituted by your replacement Goalkeeper, if he played in the
                          Gameweek.</li>
                        <li>If any of your outfield players don't play in the Gameweek, they
                          will be substituted by the highest priority outfield substitute
                          who played in the Gameweek and doesn't break the formation rules
                          (eg. If your starting team has 3 defenders, a defender can only
                          be replaced by another defender).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </div>

                      <p>After selecting your squad you can buy and sell players in the
                        transfer market. Unlimited transfers can be made at no cost until
                        your first deadline.</p>

                      <p>After your first deadline you will receive 1 free transfer each
                        Gameweek. Each additional transfer you make in the same Gameweek
                        will deduct 4 points from your total score (Classic scoring) and
                        match score (Head-to-Head scoring) at the start of the next
                        Gameweek. </p>

                      <p>If you do not use your free transfer, you are able to make an
                        additional free transfer the following Gameweek. If you do not use
                        this saved free transfer in the following Gameweek, it will be
                        carried over until you do. You can never have more than 1 saved
                        transfer.</p>

                      <h5>Wildcards</h5>

                      <p>For information on wildcards please refer to the chips section of the
                        rules.</p>

                      <h3>Player Prices</h3>

                      <p>Player prices change during the season dependent on the popularity of
                        the player in the transfer market. Player prices do not change until
                        the season starts.</p>

                      <p>The price shown on your transfers page is a player's selling price.
                        This selling price may be less than the player's current purchase
                        price as a sell-on fee of 50% (rounded up to the nearest £0.1m) will
                        be applied on any profits made on that player.</p>

                      <p>For example, if you buy a player for £8.3m and when you transfer him
                        his price is £9.0m, his selling price will be £8.6m.</p>

                      <h5>Clean sheets</h5>

                      <p>A clean sheet is awarded for not conceding a goal whilst on the pitch
                        and playing at least 60 minutes (excluding injury time).</p>

                      <p>If a player has been substituted when a goal is conceded this will
                        not affect any clean sheet bonus.</p>

                      <h5>Red Cards</h5>

                      <p>If a player receives a red card, they will continue to be penalised
                        for goals conceded by their team.</p>

                      <p>Red card deductions include any points deducted for yellow cards</p>

                      <h5>Assists</h5>

                      <p>Assists are awarded to the player from the goal scoring team, who
                        makes the final pass before a goal is scored. An assist is awarded
                        whether the pass was intentional (that it actually creates the
                        chance) or unintentional (that the player had to dribble the ball or
                        an inadvertent touch or shot created the chance).</p>

                      <p>If an opposing player touches the ball after the final pass before a
                        goal is scored, significantly altering the intended destination of
                        the ball, then no assist is awarded. Should a touch by an opposing
                        player be followed by a defensive error by another opposing outfield
                        player then no assist will be awarded. If the goal scorer loses and
                        then regains possession, then no assist is awarded.</p>

                      <h6>Rebounds</h6>

                      <p>If a shot on goal is blocked by an opposition player, is saved by a
                        goalkeeper or hits the woodwork, and a goal is scored from the
                        rebound, then an assist is awarded.</p>

                      <h6>Own Goals</h6>

                      <p>If a player shoots or passes the ball and forces an opposing player
                        to put the ball in his own net, then an assist is awarded.</p>

                      <h6>Penalties and Free-Kicks</h6>

                      <p>In the event of a penalty or free-kick, the player earning the
                        penalty or free-kick is awarded an assist if a goal is directly
                        scored, but not if he takes it himself, in which case no assist is
                        given.</p>

                      <h6>Finalising Assists</h6>

                      <p>Assist points awarded by Opta within Fantasy Premier League are
                        calculated using additional stats which may differ from other
                        websites. For example, some other sites would not show an assist
                        where a player has won a penalty.</p>

                      <p>For the avoidance of doubt, points awarded in-game are subject to
                        change up until one hour after the final whistle of the last match
                        of any given day. Once the points have all been updated on that day,
                        no further adjustments to points will be made.</p>

                      <h5>Bonus Points</h5>

                      <p>The Bonus Points System (BPS) utilises a range of statistics to
                        create a BPS score for every player. The three best performing
                        players in each match will be awarded bonus points. 3 points will be
                        awarded to the highest scoring player, 2 to the second best and 1 to
                        the third. </p>

                      <p>Examples of how bonus point ties will be resolved are as follows:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>If there is a tie for first place, Players 1 &amp; 2 will
                          receive 3 points each and Player 3 will receive 1 point.</li>
                        <li>If there is a tie for second place, Player 1 will receive 3
                          points and Players 2 and 3 will receive 2 points each.</li>
                        <li>If there is a tie for third place, Player 1 will receive 3
                          points, Player 2 will receive 2 points and Players 3 &amp; 4
                          will receive 1 point each.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h5>How is the BPS score calculated?</h5>

                      <p>Players score BPS points based on the following statistics (one point
                        for each unless otherwise stated):</p>

                      <h5>League Types</h5>

                      <h6>Private Leagues</h6>

                      <p>Private leagues are the heart and soul of the game, where you compete
                        against your friends. Just create a league and then send out the

                      <ul>

                      <h6>League Scoring</h6>

                      <p>All leagues score on either a Classic or Head-to-Head basis.</p>

                      <h6>Classic Scoring</h6>

                      <p>In a league with classic scoring, teams are ranked based on their
                        total points in the game. You can join or leave a league with
                        classic scoring at any point during the season.</p>

                      <p>In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has made the least
                        amount of transfers will be positioned higher. Any transfers made
                        using a wildcard or free hit will not count towards total transfers
                        made.</p>

                      <p>Classic scoring leagues are run over a number of phases:</p>

                      <p>Any transfer point deductions in the Gameweek before a phase starts
                        won't be deducted from the phase score. For example, any transfers
                        made in Gameweek 3 (preparing for Gameweek 4) won't be deducted from
                        your September score.</p>

                      <h6>Head-to-Head Scoring</h6>

                      <p>In a league with head-to-head scoring, every team plays a match
                        against another team in the league each Gameweek. The match result
                        is based on the Gameweek score of each team minus any transfer
                        points spent preparing for the Gameweek.</p>

                      <p>3 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a draw, teams are then
                        ranked on points earned in Head-to-Head matches.</p>

                      <p>Head-to-Head fixtures are generated at the start of the league's
                        first Gameweek. Once these fixtures have been generated the league
                        is locked and teams will not be able to join or leave.</p>

                      <p>If a Head-to-Head league has an odd number of teams then an average
                        team will join the league to ensure each team has a fixture every
                        Gameweek. This team will always score the Gameweek average.</p>

                      <p>In the event of a tie between teams, the team who has most game
                        points will be positioned higher.</p>

                      <h6>Head-to-Head Knock-out stage</h6>

                      <p>Optionally, a Head-to-Head league may end with a knock-out stage over
                        up to 3 Gameweeks with the league winner decided by a match in the
                        final Gameweek. The automatically entered average team will not
                        enter the knock-out stage, their place being taken by the next
                        placed team.</p>

                      <p>In the event of a tie between teams in a Head-to-Head knock-out
                        match, the following tie-breaks will be used:</p>

                      <ol>
                        <li>Most goals scored in the Gameweek</li>
                        <li>Fewest goals conceded in the Gameweek</li>
                        <li>Virtual coin toss</li>

                      <p>The top 4,194,304 scorers in Gameweek 16 will enter the first round.
                        If there are more than 4,194,304 qualifiers then there will be a
                        random draw amongst the lowest scorers to see who qualifies.</p>


                      <h5>How it works</h5>
                      <p>Each qualifying team will be randomly drawn against another in the
                        first round. The winner (the team with the highest Gameweek score
                        minus any transfer points), will progress to the second round and
                        another random draw, the losers are out! This process continues
                        until the final Gameweek when the two remaining teams contest the
                        cup final.</p>
                      <p>If a cup match is drawn, then the following tie-breaks will be
                        applied until a winner is found:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Most goals scored in the Gameweek</li>

                </p>

                <p>
                  2. For the avoidance of doubt, all decisions in respect of the Game (including
                  conditions of application or Registration, team or league names, deadlines
                  within the Game, winners of Prizes or the Game Rules (as defined below)), shall
                  be at the Premier League's absolute discretion. All such decisions will be final
                  and no correspondence will be entered into.
                </p>

                <p>
                  3. Registration for the Game is open to both UK and non-UK residents. Employees

                  Limited (the "Premier League") may enter the Game but are ineligible to win any
                  Prizes (as defined below). If such person would otherwise win a Prize, the Prize
                  shall be awarded to the next placed Player.
                </p>

                <p>
                  4. Under 18s may Register to play the Game, however the consent of a parent or

                  5. No purchase of any item or service is necessary in order to enter the Game
                  and no payment is required from you.
                </p>

                <p>
                  6. Registrations must not be made by agents or third parties. No responsibility
                  can be accepted for lost, delayed or incomplete Registrations or Registrations
                  not received by the Premier League for any reason. Any such Registrations will
                  be deemed void.
                </p>

                <p>
                  7. There is no limit on the number of Registrations per household or
                  organisation. However, only one Registration in to the Game per unique
                  registered user of the Site or App is permitted. Individuals are not permitted
                  to register multiple accounts on the Site or App.
                </p>

                <p>
                  8. While there is no closing date for Registration, and applications can be made
                  throughout the Premier League season, the Premier League will publish deadlines
                  from time to time by which you must be Registered as a Player in order to
                  qualify for points awarded in respect of any round of matches in the Premier
                  League competition. Any such information on how and when to enter for the Game
                  forms part of these terms and conditions and shall be binding on you.
                </p>

                <p>
                  9. The Premier League reserves the right to suspend and delete Registrations
                  that contain team or league names which are deemed to be inappropriate or
                  offensive. Depending on the seriousness of the situation, the Player's account
                  may be deleted in its entirety without notice. Any such decision to do so by the
                  Premier League is final. Alternatively, the Premier League may reject such a
                  name and require a new one to be selected within 7 days. A failure to do so, or
                  in the event another inappropriate or offensive name is selected, the Player
                  will be held to be in breach of these terms and conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  10. In submitting a Registration and becoming a Player, you will be providing
                  personal data to the Premier League. Any personal data which you do submit will
                  be processed in accordance with the Premier League's Privacy Policy, which can
                  be found here: <a
                    href="/privacy-policy">https://www.premierleague.com/privacy-policy</a>
                  and in accordance with relevant data protection legislation including the
                  General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and the Data Protection Act 2018.
                </p>

                <p>
                  11. We will only share your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and as
                  set out in these terms and conditions. Where a Player is a winner of a Prize,
                  the winner's name may be published on the Site or App in accordance with terms
                  28 and 29. The Premier League may also share your personal data if required to
                  do so by a competent authority or court within the United Kingdom.
                </p>

                <p>
                  12. Both UK and non-UK Players Registering for the Game are subject to their
                  teams being automatically entered into a "Country League". A Country League is a
                  mini-league named after the country entered by the Player when submitting a
                  Registration. In association with the official Premier League broadcaster in
                  selected territories, the Premier League may choose (but will not guarantee) to
                  offer a Prize to the overall winner of such Country Leagues. The nature of the
                  Prize and the countries selected for this purpose are at the sole discretion of
                  the Premier League. Entry into a Country League is automatic but participation
                  in no way obligates the Player to receive marketing communications from the
                  Premier League or broadcaster unless otherwise indicated during Registration to
                  the Site or App.
                </p>

                <p>
                  13. Players (and Players on behalf of others and organisations) can establish
                  mini-leagues in accordance with the Game Rules. The Premier League does not
                  condone Players charging for entry to mini-leagues they have created, strongly
                  encourages Players not to join such leagues and cannot be held responsible for
                  their management or any loss suffered through Players’ involvement in such
                  leagues.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  The Game Rules
                </h4>
                <p>
                  14. The Game will be governed by the Game Rules (as amended from time to time)
                  published on the Site (and accessible via the App) by the Premier League ("Game
                  Rules"). The Premier League reserves the right to alter, amend or supplement the
                  Game Rules in its absolute discretion in the event of any circumstances beyond
                  its reasonable control arising or where it considers it desirable to do so. You
                  agree that no liability shall attach to the Premier League as a result of any
                  such change and so are advised to check the Game Rules regularly. The Game Rules
                  form part of these terms and conditions and by Registering for the Game, you
                  accept the Game Rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                  15. The Premier League will be the sole decision-maker of any matter of
                  interpretation of the Game Rules and any aspect of the content of, or playing
                  of, the Game. The Premier League will not enter into correspondence relating to
                  such matters and its decision as to any matter arising out of or in connection
                  with the Game Rules including but not limited to the allocation of points to any
                  Player and/or the award of any Prize and/or any ranking or league table shall be
                  final and conclusive.
                </p>




                <h4>
                  Prizes and Winner's Details
                </h4>

                <p>
                  16. The Premier League may choose to award prizes in respect of the Game
                  ("Prizes"). Such Prizes will be available at the discretion of the Premier

                  to you at all times and that the contents are correct and accurate, it cannot
                  make any legal commitment to you that this will be the case. However, the
                  Premier League will exercise reasonable skill and care in providing any service
                  to you.

                </p>
                <p>
                  b) any business loss you may suffer, including loss of revenue, profits, or
                  anticipated savings (whether those losses are the direct or indirect result of
                  the Premier League's default);
                </p>
                <p>
                  c) loss which you suffer other than as a result of our failure to comply with
                  these terms or our negligence or breach of statutory duty;
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>

                <p>
                  35. Any breach by you of the Game Rules from time to time shall also be a breach
                  of these terms and conditions.

                  37. If you are barred or disqualified from being Registered as a Player, you
                  shall not be eligible to participate in the Game under any other identity or

                </p>

                <p>
                  38. If any of these terms are determined to be illegal, invalid, or otherwise
                  enforceable then the remaining terms shall continue in full force and effect.
                </p>

                <p>
                  39. These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance
                  with the laws of England and Wales and the parties agree to submit to the
                  exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.
